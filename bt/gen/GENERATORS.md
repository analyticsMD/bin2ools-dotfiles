# GENERATED FILES: 
# --------------------
And also, file types. 

```

# Generated files

There are two categories. 
 
First are those files meant to be sourced directly by the shell, 
such as functions, aliases, bash scripts, and bash completions.
These are intended to help with speed and accuracy when working 
in a large environment. 
 
The second class those that keep structured data locally, such as 
pregenerated AWS configs, encrypted AWS credential files, and other 
similar configs. Sometimes these appear in their own exclusive formats. 

This category is generlly placed under ${BT}/sources/complete.d


# CONFIG DIRECTORIES: 
 
# ${BINTOOLS}/sources      -- sourceable shell files, TAB completions, 
#                             bash aliases and functions, etc. 
# 
#         /generate.d      -- generated sourceable shell files, 
#                             TAB completions for internal resources, etc.
#
#           /config.d      -- dynamically built configs, e.g. sshd configs,
#                             built-in AWS configs, etc.  These are NOT
#                             assumed by the shell, often are precisely 
#                             organized according to opinionated rules, 
#                             but have greate value when it comes to working
#                             efficiently within a complicated environment. 
#
#             /aws.d      --  intended specifically as a cache for information
#                             about AWS as a speedup to other scripts. 
#  
```

# FILE TYPES (and file endings)

# NOTE 
Scripts that are under development (but not yet considered release quality)
are generally prefixed with an underscore. Scripts with an underscore will 
not be executed by any of the auto-* mechanisms that keep scripts up to date. 

```
#
# -- .gen            generated datasets (bash5 arrays & associative arrays) .src, .cmp  
# -- .(src|sh)       sourced files (bash aliases & functions, scripts and utils)
#    
# -- .(cmpl)         Bash and zsh tab completion files. 

# -- .(dat|yq|jq|xq) autogenerated data sets (not for shell consumption), 
#                    json, and other languages.
```


# GENERATORS  

Where they live.  How they are run.  


```
-- ${BT}/utils/gen  Generators of all types live here.  There is also a 
                    multi-threaded wrapper for Easy, unattended execution, so your 
                    automated scripts reflect a recent state of your cloud footprint 
                    as it evolves.
